# Data-Structure-Project
This Text Editor is my Final Project of Data Structure.

# Overview
This system loads a dictionary from the "outfile.txt" file and provides suggestions based on the user input. It is implemented through two classes, which signifies the node in the trie and the other manages the Trie operations.

# Working
Words are added to the Trie during the initialization from the "outfile.txt" file.
It validates the user input and offers suggestions for misspelled words.
Presents suggestions based on the user input and the Trie data structure.
Utilizes a simple console-based User interface for user interaction.
Choose option 1 to get suggestions and option 2 to exits.
Input a string for which suggestions are needed.
Specify the desired number of suggestions.

# Tools and language
* C++
* Visual Studio
* "Outfile.txt" containing a list of words

# Prerequisites
Install a C++ compiler on your system(e.g: Visual Studio).
The code reads the data from a file named "outfile.txt" to load the Trie.
Ensure "outfile.txt" is available and includes words seperated by newline characters.
Run the executable to launch the application.
Follow on-screen prompts to perform actions.

# Conclusions
The provided C++ code implements a Trie data structure to efficiently store and retrieve strings. The code provides a simple interactive interface for users to obtain suggestions from the Trie, enhancing the usability of the implemented data structure.
To successfully use and understand this code, familiarity with C++ programming, Trie data structures and file operations and error handling is essential.
